=============

Deterministic builds of SQLite using Gitian

__These have not been extensively tested.__  The Linux descriptor builds a working library on my machine (tested exactly once) that libcoind successfully uses.  The Windows descriptor builds something without obvious build errors (tested exactly once).  Other than that, __no testing has been conducted.__  Feedback invited!

__Do not use these descriptors for anything other than testing unless you are willing to accept the consequences.__
